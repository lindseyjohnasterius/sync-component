# sync-component
A simple component for syncing two browsers with WebRTC

This component is an easy way to sync
two web browsers using only an HTML Element.

To use, include this index.js file and linked
JS files. 

Use like :
```html
  <sync-component></sync-component>
```

Sync Component has no concept of a "user", 
and it never will. It should be used and reasoned 
about as two specific devices and how they will interact.
